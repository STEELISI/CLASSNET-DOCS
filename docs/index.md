= COMUNDA Portal

The COMUNDA portal is a place for security and network researchers to
access datasets shared
by the [CLASSNET](https://ant.isi.edu/classnet/) project. Currently, several
different types of datasets are shared, including: (1) datasets of hosts
replying to periodic probes, (2) datasets of traffic from large academic
networks, (3) datasets of traffic going to a Darknet. In addition to
sharing *on-going* dataset collections, COMUNDA also contains *curated snapshots* 
of relevant security and network events from these datasets, with corresponding
labels.

Please explore our support documentation to learn how you can access the
datasets and how you can discuss these datasets with the broader research community.

CLASSNET project has been funded by the National Science Foundation via awards #8115780 and #1823192.
