## Requesting Datasets

If you want to request a dataset, please click "Request" button at the
bottom right of the Dataset view. You will be asked to fill in some
information, such as who will use the dataset, for what purpose and their
contact information. You will also be shown a Data Use Agreement. Filling
in your information and submitting a dataset request counts as you legally
accepting the Data Use Agreement.

Once request is submitted it will go through our approval process, and you
will receive regular email correspondence about its progress. Once you are
approved, you will receive an email with directions how to access the dataset.

Some datasets can be downloaded onto your machine. Some require access via
Google Big Table or similar public cloud service. Some datasets can only be used at a given machine,
administered by the dataset provider. The approval email will contain all the
necessary information, and it will also provide a contact information that you
can use if you have any questions.

In some cases, a dataset you request may be part of a bigger collection of
datasets, which use the same Data Use Agreement. If you were already approved
to access another dataset from the same collection, your request may be
expedited. In any case, the email correspondence you receive from us will
guide you through the process.

In some cases, your request may be declined. Since each data provider has
their own criteria for approval, some providers may be very
restrictive, while others may be more open. If your request is declined,
you will receive an email detailing the provider's reason for this decision.
Please understand that many data providers must work with their own
and their customers' legal departments to provide these datasets, and that
some approval criteria may seem unfair to you, but it is legally required
by entities that govern the provider's business. Approval criteria may
also change over time as providers learn about benefits of sharing their
datasets with researchers.
