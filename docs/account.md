## Opening Account

COMUNDA does not support stand-alone authentication. Instead, you can choose
one of three third-party authentication services:
    - CILogon (log in with your institutional account)
    - Github
    - Google

On the first login, COMUNDA will receive your name and email from the
third-party service you used. We will also ask for your position at the
research institution where you work or study, and for affiliation (name of
your institution). After inputting this data, you can start using the portal.
