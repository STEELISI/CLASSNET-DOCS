## Contributing Datasets

If you or your organization have datasets, which you would like to distribute
via our portal, please contact us via
[comunda-ops@googlegroups.com](mailto:comunda-ops@googlegroups.com).
Our process to publish a new dataset requires a number of steps:

1. Create an account in Comunda if you do not have one yet
2. Write a Data Use Agreement (DUA) that incorporates usage
   requirements that outlines acceptable use of your dataset by
   researchers.
3. Write
   [comunda-ops@googlegroups.com](mailto:comunda-ops@googlegroups.com)
   with a request to allow your Comunda to publish datasets.  In this
   E-Mail provide the DUA you intend to use.
4. Once your contributor account is approved, 
   [submit a new dataset publication request](https://comunda.isi.edu/contributeDatasets)
   through the Comunda portal.  Be ready to answer the metadata questions
   listed below.  Once submitted it should appear online within an hour.
5. Once published, handle requests for access to the dataset.
   Notifications will be sent to you via E-Mail.

### Mechanisms for Sharing

Comunda will typically only host your dataset's metadata (title,
description, etc), but we can also host your entire dataset in
addition to its metadata.

### Mechanisms for Data Access

Currently we support three types of data access in our metadata:

* download - the researcher will obtain a link from you to download
  the dataset.
* onsite - the researcher will obtain login credentials for a system
  that has access to the dataset.  This is usually at the data
  provider's site.
* cloud - the researcher will obtain information about how to access
  the dataset within a cloud provider's infrastructure.

### Mechanisms for Approving Researcher Access to Datasets

Once a researcher submits a request for a dataset or access to it, and
has signed and submitted the required DUA, that request is routed for
approval via email.

Dataset providers can decide who should be in charge of approving
requests approvals -- someone from the Comunda project or someone or a
team from the provider's organization. Providers can decide what their
criteria is for approval, such as whether to allow access only from
certain regions, or only from university faculty appointments, etc.
Once an access request is approved, the researcher will receive an
email with instructions how to access the data.  Note that access
instructions must be provided by the dataset provider.

## Metadata expected during submission

The following lists the fields that must be filled out during dataset
publication request submission:

- dataset name: a short name for the dataset
- brief description: a short sentence or two describing the dataset
- detailed description: a longer description that describes the collection
- the dataset "class": describing if the dataset is restricted, quasi
  restricted, classified, or unclassified
- commercial use: whether the dataset can be used for commercial
  purposes
- publication review requirements: whether any publications making use
  of the dataset must be reviewed by the dataset provider before
  publication.
- availability: when did the dataset become available, and when does
  access cease
- in progress: whether or not the dataset is part of an ongoing,
  continually updating collection or whether collection has ended
- collection date ranges: when the collection start and stop
- dataset size: what is the size of the date in question
- indefinite use: whether or not the dataset can be retained and used
  indefinitely
- keywords: what keywords would be useful for helping researchers find
  your dataset
- format: what format is your dataset stored in?
- anonymization: was the dataset anonymized in some way?
- access type: how can the data be accessed upon approval (https,
  rsync, google BigQuery, or other)
- provider name: The name of the providing entity
- access duration: once approved, how long will the user be able to
  access the dataset
- Grouping ID: ????
- Data Use Agreement: the DUA to be applied
- IRB required: whether or not an IRB approval is required for use
- Link to dataset: whether the data will be downloadable or will
  require on-site access with an account
- README: a markdown, text or html README file that fully describes
  the dataset.  Note that this will be converted to text when archived
  in the comunda catalog -- fancy formatting is not possible at this
  time.
