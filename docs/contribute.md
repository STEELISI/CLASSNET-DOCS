## Contributing Datasets

If you or your organization have datasets, which you would like to distribute
via our portal, please contact us via [comunda-ops@googlegroups.com](mailto:comunda-ops@googlegroups.com).

### Mechanisms for Sharing

We can host only your metadata for each dataset, or we can host your dataset and its metadata.
You would provide the Data Use Agreement (DUA), outlining acceptable use of your
dataset by researchers.

### Mechanisms for Researcher Access Approval

Once a researcher submits the request for a dataset, and the signed DUA, that request
is routed for approval via email. You can decide who should be in charge of request
approvals, e.g., someone from CLASSNET project or someone from your organization. You can
also designate multiple approvers. You can further decide what is *your criteria* for
approval, e.g., do you want to allow access only to researchers from some countries, or
only to faculty but not students, etc. Once the request is approved, the researcher
will receive an email with instructions how to access data.

### Mechanisms for Data Access

Currently we support three types of data access:

* download - researcher obtains a link to download the dataset
* onsite - researcher obtains login credentials to log into a machine, usually at the data
provider's site, to access and process the data
* cloud - researcher obtains information how to access the dataset on a cloud
