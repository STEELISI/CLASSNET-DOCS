Currently, several different types of datasets are shared, including: (1) datasets of hosts replying to periodic probes, (2) datasets of traffic from large academic networks, (3) datasets of traffic going to a Darknet. In addition to sharing on-going dataset collections, COMUNDA also contains curated snapshots of relevant security and network events from these datasets, with corresponding labels. Please explore our support documentation to learn how you can access the datasets and how you can discuss these datasets with the broader research community.

You can search using keywords, type of dataset and the dataset provider's organization. Search results are displayed in a short form. You can click on \"View\" at the bottom right to see expanded results. Request a dataset - if you identify a dataset of interest to your research, you can request it. Usually this takes a few days for the request to be vetted and processed. Requests for datasets from the same provider or in the same category may be expedited on our end. Review and rate the dataset - you can input positive or negative reviews and rating for any dataset, which you have previously requested. Please be respectful of data providers and use objective, professional language in your reviews. Share your labels and label corrections - some datasets will be accompanied by labels, e.g., denoting benign and malicious traffic. You can submit corrections to these labels, or even submit your own, alternative approach to labeling a given dataset.","title":"Searching, viewing and rating"},{"location":"dataset/#interacting-with-datasets","text":"There are several actions you can take to interact with datasets: Search for datasets - this is enabled both for users that are not logged in and for logged in users.

Please follow the instructions below to correct or share labels. Correcting a Few Labels \uf0c1 Check out the public repository for labels: git clone https://github.com/STEELISI/COMUNDA.git Find the folder where the affected dataset is, and then find the folder where our official labels reside Fork a new branch: git checkout -b your-chosen-name Apply your changes Commit and push git commit -a -m 'some message here' && git push origin your-chosen-name Go to https://github.com/STEELISI/COMUNDA and submit a pull request. Make sure to offer a detailed explanation in your request about the reasoning for the corrections you suggested. Share New Labels \uf0c1 Check out the public repository for labels: git clone https://github.com/STEELISI/COMUNDA.git Find the folder where the affected dataset is, and cd into it Fork a new branch: git checkout -b your-chosen-name Create a new folder for your labels. Name that folder in a way that denotes your or your research group's identity and the purpose of the labels, e.g., JMirkovic-ddos-attack Place the following information and files into the folder: Your name and contact information in README.md file The label format in README.md file. Make sure to explain each label's meaning. The label file if any (sometimes the labeling program may take input needed to label, without the label file) The program, which can be ran on the given dataset to produce some unique record ID and the desired label. This program may take input from command line or take label file as input. Provide examples how to run the program (and specific inputs) to label the given dataset For example, if I were to label DDoS attacks on the large dataset containing Netflow records, I may choose to have labels in the format of attack events, e.g., start time of attack in UTC, stop time of attack in UTC, target, type of attack or attack traffic's signature, I would specify this format in the README.md file, and list the types of attacks I can label. I would place the events into the label file. I would also provide a program, which reads Netflow records and my label file, and prints a unique record ID (timestamp-sourceIP-sourceport-destIP-destport) and the label out. I would put the full example of the command line needed to run my program in README.md Commit and push git commit -a -m 'some message here' && git push origin your-chosen-name Go to https://github.com/STEELISI/COMUNDA and submit a pull request.

Filling in your information and submitting a dataset request counts as you legally accepting the Data Use Agreement. Once request is submitted it will go through our approval process, and you will receive regular email correspondence about its progress. Once you are approved, you will receive an email with directions how to access the dataset. Some datasets can be downloaded onto your machine. Some require access via Google Big Table. Some datasets can only be used at a given machine, administered by the dataset provider. The approval email will contain all the necessary information, and it will also provide a contact information that you can use if you have any questions. In some cases, a dataset you request may be part of a bigger collection of datasets, which use the same Data Use Agreement.
