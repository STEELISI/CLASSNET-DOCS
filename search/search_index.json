Currently, several different types of datasets are shared, including: (1) datasets of hosts replying to periodic probes, (2) datasets of traffic from large academic networks, (3) datasets of traffic going to a Darknet. In addition to sharing on-going dataset collections, COMUNDA also contains curated snapshots of relevant security and network events from these datasets, with corresponding labels. Please explore our support documentation to learn how you can access the datasets and how you can discuss these datasets with the broader research community. CLASSNET project has been funded by the National Science Foundation via awards #8115780 and #1823192.","title":"Welcome to COMUNDA"},{"location":"account/","text":"this is account placeholder","title":"Opening Account"},{"location":"dataset/","text":"this is dataset placeholder","title":"Searching for Datasets"},{"location":"glossary/","text":"This is glossary placeholder","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"request/","text":"this is request placeholder","title":"Interacting with Datasets"},{"location":"support/","text":"this is support placeholder","title":"Support"}]}
