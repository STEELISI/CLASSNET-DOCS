You can further decide what is your criteria for approval, e.g., do you want to allow access only to researchers from some countries, or only to faculty but not students, etc. Once the request is approved, the researcher will receive an email with instructions how to access data.

You can search using keywords, type of dataset and the dataset provider's organization. Search results are displayed in a short form. You can click on \"View\" at the bottom right to see expanded results. Request a dataset - if you identify a dataset of interest to your research, you can request it. Usually this takes a few days for the request to be vetted and processed. Requests for datasets from the same provider or in the same category may be expedited on our end. Review and rate the dataset - you can input positive or negative reviews and rating for any dataset, which you have previously requested. Please be respectful of data providers and use objective, professional language in your reviews. Share your labels and label corrections - some datasets will be accompanied by labels, e.g., denoting benign and malicious traffic. You can submit corrections to these labels, or even submit your own, alternative approach to labeling a given dataset.","title":"Searching, viewing and rating"},{"location":"dataset/#interacting-with-datasets","text":"There are several actions you can take to interact with datasets: Search for datasets - this is enabled both for users that are not logged in and for logged in users.

Please follow the instructions below to correct or share labels. Correcting a Few Labels \uf0c1 You can make corrections by interacting with Github or by giving us a URL with the corrected labels. Github interaction \uf0c1 Check out the public repository for labels: git clone https://github.com/STEELISI/COMUNDA.git Find the folder where the affected dataset is, and then find the folder where our official labels reside Fork a new branch: git checkout -b your-chosen-name Apply your changes Commit and push git commit -a -m 'some message here' && git push origin your-chosen-name Go to COMUNDA Github and submit a pull request. Make sure to offer a detailed explanation in your request about the reasoning for the corrections you suggested. Giving us a URL \uf0c1 On COMUNDA Web page log in and then follow Label Datasets link on the left. This will enable you to provide us a URL with materials describing your label correction.

Make sure to explain each label's meaning. The label file if any (sometimes the labeling program may take input needed to label, without the label file) The program, which can be ran on the given dataset to produce some unique record ID and the desired label. This program may take input from command line or take label file as input. Provide examples how to run the program (and specific inputs) to label the given dataset For example, if I were to label DDoS attacks on the large dataset containing Netflow records, I may choose to have labels in the format of attack events, e.g., start time of attack in UTC, stop time of attack in UTC, target, type of attack or attack traffic's signature, I would specify this format in the README.md file, and list the types of attacks I can label. I would place the events into the label file. I would also provide a program, which reads Netflow records and my label file, and prints a unique record ID (timestamp-sourceIP-sourceport-destIP-destport) and the label out.
